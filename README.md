# Joust 0: Link Tester (Training)

This joust is an unofficial training joust. You can find a tutorial for completing it in the [Onshore Jousts wiki](https://github.com/onshore-jousts/joust-core/wiki).

Jousters will create an implementation of a link tester. Given a URL, the link tester will return true if the link:
 * Is a properly formatted http(s) link
 * Returns a "Success" class status code in response to a GET request after following any redirects
and false in any other scenario.

Folder structure for this joust is as follows:
 * /src (contains all starting code)
 * /test (contains provided test cases)
 * .gitignore
 * README.md

### Setup Instructions
1. Fork and clone the repository ([see the quickstart if you need help](https://github.com/onshore-jousts/joust-core/wiki/Quickstart))
2. Restore all dependencies when prompted
3. You're all set!

### Testing Instructions
See the tutorial or the quickstart in the [wiki](https://github.com/onshore-jousts/joust-core/wiki).

### Scoring Considerations
As this is a practice joust, no official scoring will take place
